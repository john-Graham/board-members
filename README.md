# Board Members
This WordPress plugin creates a Custom Post Type (CPT) containing content for the purpose of displaying board members.   This requires Advance Custom Fields (ACF) and uses gutenberg blocks to display the data.   Currently set up for use with the College of Engineering WordPress theme, will be adding additional display for UW theme as well. 


## Getting started
This project uses npm and gulp for compilation. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
2. Once the dependencies are installed, run `gulp watch` to compile individual CSS files for each block.

After completing these steps, you will be ready to use the plugin.
